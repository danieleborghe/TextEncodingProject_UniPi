# TextEncodingProject_UniPi

The project consists in the encoding in XML language of a letter of the Italian composer Vincenzo Bellini to the jurist Giovanni Battista Perucchini (November 25, 1830). The visualization is allowed through a very simple and static web application, implemented through XSLT language. The encoding in XML language complies with [TEI standards](https://tei-c.org/).

* This project was carried out in relation to the course of *Texts encoding* of the degree course in [Digital humanities](https://infouma.fileli.unipi.it/laurea-triennale/) (*Informatica umanistica*), at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english).

* More information about the university course are avaiable [here](https://infouma.fileli.unipi.it/laurea-triennale/insegnamenti-20192020/corso/?lang=it&cds=IFU-L&anno=2020&id=47154).
